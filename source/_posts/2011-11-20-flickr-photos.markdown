With the help of a [jquery flickr feed plugin](http://www.gethifi.com/blog/a-jquery-flickr-feed-plugin) and [colorbox](http://jacklmoore.com/colorbox/), I now have a [photos](/Photos) page which features the most recent photos from my flickr account. Unfortunately, this requires javascript to view the images. How about content for non-javascript enabled browsers? Well, you'll just have to follow the link to my [flickr photostream](http://flickr.com/photos/jtw84).
