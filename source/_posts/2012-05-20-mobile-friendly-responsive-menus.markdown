As Brad Frost points out in his [responsive navigation patterns article](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/web/responsive-nav-patterns/), small screens make designing a usable menu
difficult.

For a large site with lots of menu items (e.g. a resource site) how do
we cram it all into a usable menu with a good mobile UX?

It's tempting to just take the ["easy route" to mobile menus](https://github.com/mattkersley/Responsive-Menu) and use native select
(dropdown) menus. While it's snappy and usable, it's a little
disorienting as it removes the user from the look and feel of your
website.

I came across this [drill down menu from 2009](http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex1/drilldownmenu.htm) and think it might work well on a small screen. I haven't tried it out yet, but nothing else looks promising at the moment.

Thoughts?
