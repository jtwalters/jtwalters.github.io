[PosteRazor](http://posterazor.sourceforge.net/) must be the greatest thing since sliced bread.

The PosteRazor cuts a raster image into pieces which can afterwards be printed out and assembled to a poster.

Yep, that's right, you can assemble a poster from copy paper on the cheap. But "how can I avoid the ugliness of scotch tape and paper curl?" you might ask. Good question!

I found [8.5x14 legal sized sheets with removable adhesive backing](http://www.onlinelabels.com/OL813.htm) from onlinelabels.com which would let you slap your paper right onto the painted wall surface â€” no tape, no curling. Woohoo!
