Can Windows 8 plus a pair of Nvidia Quadro 450 graphics cards really give me a 12.5 Megapixel display? It sounds too good to be true. How many pixels is too many pixels? All good questions.

I will soon be exploring the amazing realm of large-scale touch screens. Windows 8, I hope you are a good choice.
