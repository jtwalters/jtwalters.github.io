After updating to the latest Octopress source and styles, colorbox was
severely broken due to some uncommon styles used on the body element in
the default Octopress theme.

I finally ended up replacing colorbox with [lightly](http://getlightly.com/) (5KB source). While it doesn't have many features, it did seemingly solve my problems.

Apologies in advance if you're viewing this site on IE < 8.
