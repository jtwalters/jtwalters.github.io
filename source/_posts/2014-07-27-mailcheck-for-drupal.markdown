I am now maintaining a Drupal module, [mailcheck](https://www.drupal.org/project/mailcheck). 

Here's a short description below. Check it out.

> Get fast, client-side suggestions for mistyped email addresses.
> 
> ## What is it?
> An integration of [mailcheck.js](https://github.com/tableau-mkt/mailcheck) with forms in Drupal (supports user registration, webforms)
> 
> ## What's it do?
> 
>   Someone enters `user@gmaul.com`, mailcheck asks, Did you mean `user@gmail.com`?
> 
> ### Reduces Email Bounces
> 
> Kicksend [reports of a 50% decrease](http://blog.kicksend.com/how-we-decreased-sign-up-confirmation-email-bounces-by-50/) in sign up confirmation email bounces. Try it out on [ Kicksend's join form](http://kicksend.com/join).
