I should update my blog more often. Shame on me. In order to make this
dream a reality, I'm going to attempt micro-ish posts to lessen the
burden of writing a full fledged post.

Topic of the day: I love Trader Joe's [Breakfast Burritos](http://www.traderjoes.com/fearless-flyer/article.asp?article_id=156).

One tiny addition: my twitter feed is on the sidebar now. Exciting.
