## Hi.

{% img right /images/joel-400x400.jpg 200 200 %}

I'm Joel Walters, a web developer living in Seattle, WA.

A recent transplant to the Pacific Northwest, I lived most of my life in Charlotte, NC, and graduated from [UNCC](http://www.uncc.edu) with a degree in Computer Science.

I have a strong passion for designing and developing for the web. I'm excited about providing great user experiences across the plethora of web-connected devices.

Some of my hobbies include photography, racquetball, hiking, billiards, and soapmaking.
