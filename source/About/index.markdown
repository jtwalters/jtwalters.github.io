## About Me

{% img right /images/joel-400x400.jpg 200 200 %}

My name is Joel Walters. I'm a well-rounded and experienced web developer, in my late twenties.

Lately, I've been focused on the open-source content management platform called Drupal. I hope to eventually contribute to my favorite Drupal modules (like Views) and to Core.

I'm currently a full time web developer at the University of Washington. Since October 2010, I've been hard at work revamping the website for the Office of Admissions.

## About This Site

This site is powered by Octopress (a static site generator using Jekyll). It was powered by Drupal, but that was overkill for a blog. :)
