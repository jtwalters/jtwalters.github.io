## Hi.

{% img headshot /images/joel-2020.jpg %} I'm Joel Walters, a web developer living in the Seattle, WA area.

I grew up in Charlotte, NC, graduated from [UNCC](http://www.uncc.edu) with a degree in Computer Science, and then shortly thereafter moved to the Pacific Northwest in 2010.

I have a strong passion for designing and developing for the web. I'm excited about providing great user experiences across the plethora of web-connected devices.

Some of my hobbies include running, cycling, hiking, billiards, photography, making puns, and soapmaking (although I haven't made soap in a while).

At some point I decided running — or should I say power hiking — ultramarathons was a good idea. I've finished 40+ mile foot races and keep signing up for more. I hope to finish a 100K foot race soon.

Recently, I've picked up DIY solar installations as a hobby.
